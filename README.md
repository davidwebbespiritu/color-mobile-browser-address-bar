### Installation

1. Download and extract plugin files to wp-content/plugin directory.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Go to appearance menu > Color Mobile Browser Address Bar.
4. Then just select the color that you want and then click save changes.
5. Thats it! There will be no confirmation dialog but if you goto your site and view page source and search for "theme-color" or you can just test it on the mobile chrome browser then you'll know it's working.

P.S. It didn't have a confirmation dialog because it's for future release and to lessen codes and bugs.
If you have any problem other than that. Please send me a message on the email I provided on my profile.
