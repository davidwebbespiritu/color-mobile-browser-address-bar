A WordPress plugin that lets you add a custom color to the address bar of mobile browsers.

== Description ==

A simple plugin that generates a meta tag; specifically, adding "theme-color" meta data to the head section of your page. Which enable mobile browsers to get that data and apply it to the address bar.

No more unsafe editing of your theme's header.php file. You simply follow the instructions provided and you are good to go.

== Installation ==

1. Download and extract plugin files to wp-content/plugin directory or just click Install Now in WordPress plugin page.
1. Activate the plugin.
1. Go to appearance menu > Mobile Browser Address Bar Color.
1. Then just select the color that you want.
1. Click save changes.
1. Thats it! There will be no confirmation dialog but if you goto your site and view page source and search for "theme-color" or you can just test it on mobile chrome browser then you'll know it's working.

PS: It didn't have a confirmation dialog because it's for future release and to lessen codes and bugs.
